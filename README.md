# 18026-cms-api-sample-mrss-feed-playlist
In this sample, you will learn how to use the CMS API to generate an MRSS feed based on Google's MRSS guide. This sample is similar to the MRSS Generator sample, but in this case we generate the feed from a playlist rather than a collection of videos compiled from a video search.

This repository contains all the code for your convenience:

<table>
	<thead>
		<th>File</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</thead>
	<tr>
		<td>index.html</td>
		<td>The sample as working HTML page</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>css/styles.css</td>
		<td>CSS used in the sample</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>js/index.js</td>
		<td>JavaScript used in the sample</td>
	</tr>
</table>
